it'll sort itself out


## Usage

### Inputting your own numbers because you don't actually trust me
go to #options in main.py and change that input variable to 'True', then run the program and enter your own numbers separated by whitespace, like so: '4 8 15 16 23 42' 


### Testing
install pytest on your computer by using the following command in your terminal (or command prompt, if you're not a cringe mac/linux user)

> pip install -U pytest

then add pytest to your PATH, and navigate to the /src directory, where you then type the following

> pytest main.py
